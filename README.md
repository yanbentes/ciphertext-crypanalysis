# Ciphertext Cryptanalysis

This script analyze the frequency of letters in a text, aiming to give insightful data to decipher a ciphertext.
The script shows the frequency of letters, words with a single letter, letters at the beggining and end of a word, two and three letters words frequency. It was made to decipher text written in Portuguese(pt-br) so it might not work well for other languages. To run the script do `python3 main.py`

## How to use

After running the script and seeing the text properties, to change the letters go to the file `*switch.py*` and modify the letters that you want to change in the `*switch_letters*` function. To run the script again and see the result of the modifications that you made uncomment the `*import switch*` and the lines containing the `*switch_letters*` function.
